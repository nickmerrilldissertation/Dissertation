# Dissertation

this is my dissertation at the uc berkeley school of information

my prospectus is attached

### the topic, broadly
What do physiological signals express to **people** in **social contexts**? 
I focus specificaly on interpretations around attitudes, behavior, and state of mind. *(i'm not talking about fitness/health - justify this)*

### core questions
What meanings do people build around physiological signals, and how do these meanings change in different social contexts?   
How do these interpretations arise in the first place? What mechanisms turn physiological signals into social cues?

## two case studies

**1. Interpreting another person's heartrate in risky, uncertain interactions**

*(discussion of assmmetric sharing/signals "given off" goffman)*  
lab, survey based, explain CHI paper   
**next study IMO**: is there something special about heartrate, or we have seen the same effect with any elevated (vs normal) biosignal?

**2. Contextualizing and challenging algorithmic judgments generated from breathing data in CS learning contexts**

*(discussion of signals* given*, self-representation)*  
more ethnographic, "ethno-mining" []; kids in a CS class monitor their breathing with Spire, plus self-report (by texting selfies+emoji). then the kids are shown their breathing, plus self report, on a timeline, along with different algorithmic judgements that the tracking device makes about their mood (tense, calm, focused)  
How do the contextual meanings of these signals affect what students will share, and what stories they will tell? How does the data kids see affect what stories kids are *able* to tell? (simple example: if they don't use self-report, are they less likely to contest the data they collect?)


## points of interpretation common across case studies:

**1. how does social context shape the interpretations people build around physiological signals?**   
physiological signals are ambiguous. when we see the same signal mean different things, we try to figure out what social context had to do with it. 

**2. how do these contextual interpretations affect social behavior?**  
in breathing study, interested in what people share and how they use these data to represent themselves. in heartrate study, we are more interested in trust...we know now that high heartrate can sometimes read as honesty, would we see a behavioral effect from this?

**3. what is the effect of the signal itself, versus the way the signal is represented, on the interpretations and behavior we observe?**  
in other words, is there something special about high heartrate, or would any "elevated" biosignal accomplish the same effect? is there something special about breath that makes higher-level judgements (you're tense, you're focused) more or less believable?
